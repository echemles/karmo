# Karmo
Karmo can lead the way to linking mindfulness with social action by acknowledging positive precedents. Mindfulness gives people the ability to find peace in themselves so that their actions come from a place of compassion. Each token will create a shared narrative weaving itself into our social fabric reflecting collective values and common humanity from local to global levels. This project is a phenomenological social interaction experiment that focuses on the relationship of giving and receiving. Karmo aims at healing social anxiety.

We are asking people to imagine a story that begins with them and takes them forward, touching the lives of others for as long as we share it. Maybe it is a leap of faith that I am asking people to take by participating in this project. To take a chance together in creating the world we want to exist in. 

And now as never before, in an atmosphere of international tensions, fears and insecurities, we need the channels of communication between peoples kept open. We are basically, ultimately trying to form a connection with another human being.
